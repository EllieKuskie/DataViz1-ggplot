## Setup

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(here)

# Read in the data and store as "ci_np" data object
ci_np <- read.csv("ci_np.csv")

# display the first 6 rows
head(ci_np)
```

## Q1)

```{r}
# got column names from ci_np dataset
colnames(ci_np)

# created blank plot (no axes or points)
ggplot(data = ci_np)

# made plot with axes but still no points
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors))

# added points to graph
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point()

# changed graph to column chart
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Q2)

```{r}
# made into line graph
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

# made smooth trendline instead of just connecting dots
# then made it linear using method = lm
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

# created histogram
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = visitors)) +
  geom_histogram()

# created density line instead of histogram
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = visitors)) +
  geom_density()

# made points on graph blue and differently shaped
ggplot(data = ci_np, mapping = aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +
  geom_point(shape = 8, color = "blue")
```

## Q3)

```{r}

```
